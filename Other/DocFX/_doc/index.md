# LibreAutomate C#

The program consists of an automation library and a C# script editor.

### Library
The library (Au.dll) contains functions to automate various tasks on Windows computers.

Some features: Send keys and text to the active window. Find and click buttons, links, images and other UI objects. Launch programs and auto-close windows. Process text and other data. Auto-replace text when typing. Floating toolbars, hotkeys and other triggers.

Written mostly in C#, it is a .NET library.

Free, open-source. Can be used anywhere, not only with the editor program.

### Editor
The editor program is an integrated scripting environment for creating and executing automation scripts that use the library.

The programming language for writing scripts is C#.

Can be used to create C# scripts, programs (.exe) and libraries (.dll) for any purpose. Like a mini Visual Studio.

Free, open-source.

### Where can run
Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11. Editor is 64-bit only.

### Beta
The program and the library are very young. Need more testing. Some classes/functions/etc may be changed in the future.
