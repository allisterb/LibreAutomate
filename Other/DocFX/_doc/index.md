# Derobotize Me C#

The program consists of an automation library and a script editor.

#### Library
The library contains functions to automate various tasks on Windows computers.

Some features: Send keys and text to the active window. Find and click buttons, links, images and other UI objects. Launch programs and auto-close windows. Process text and other data. Auto-replace text when typing. Floating toolbars, hotkeys and other triggers.

Written mostly in C#, it is a .NET library.

Free, open-source, MIT license.

#### Editor
The editor program is an integrated scripting environment for creating and executing automation scripts that use the library.

The programming language for writing scripts is C#. To use the library with other .NET languages need Visual Studio.

Can be used to create C# scripts, programs (.exe) and libraries (.dll) for any purpose, with or without the automation library. Like a mini Visual Studio.

Free, open-source.

#### Where can run
Editor and library can run on Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10. Not tested on Windows 11. Editor is 64-bit only.

Also need .NET 5 Runtime. Download the Desktop x64. Need only Runtime, not SDK.

#### Unfinished
Currently both editor and library are unfinished. The most important parts are finished and can be used, but some classes/functions/etc may be changed in the future.
